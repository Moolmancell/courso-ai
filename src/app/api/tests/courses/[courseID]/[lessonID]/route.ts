While they are closely related and often work together, they are distinct disciplines. <strong>UX design</strong> is about the overall feel of the experience, focusing on the user's journey to solve a problem. <strong>UI design</strong>, on the other hand, is about the product's interfaces, focusing on the visual and interactive elements like buttons, icons, and typography. Think of it this way: if a product is a house, UX design is the architectural blueprint, and UI design is the paint, furniture, and other interior decorations. A great product needs both a solid structure and a beautiful presentation.",
